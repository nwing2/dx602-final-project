    "The Body Fat dataset was downloaded from the PMLB Github repository and uploaded to the Final Project codespace. The dataset was then read in using Pandas read_csv function. As the file is a .tsv, \"sep='\\t'\" was included to ensure the tsv file is read in the appropriate format. A random sample of 10 rows was shown using the sample function, which shows that the dataset has loaded as expected and that there are 15 columns that are all in a numeric, float data type. There is a specified 'target' column, which will be the target variable in later model development. \n",

This shows that there are no nulls across all columns, and the dataset is ready to use. Additionally, a bodyfat10 variable was created that only includes the first 10 columns in the dataset. This was created by first indexing the first 9 columns in the bodyfat dataframe and getting the column names to a list. The 'target' column name was then appended to the list. This list was then used to filter the bodyfat dataframe to a 10-column version for later use. "

    "The column names of the Body Fat dataset were listed and the .info() and .describe() function were used to help initially understand the dataset and its columns. \n",
    "\n",
    "There are 15 total columns in the Body Fat dataset, with all columns having the float64 data type. All values are continous. There are 252 rows with no null values across all columns. The dataset lists the underwater body weight (density) and measures of body part circumferences for 252 men. These measures together can help to determine the percentage of body fat ('target') for each individual.  \n",
    "\n",
    "'Density' - The 'Density' column is the numeric weight of each man underwater, or body density, in the measure of grams per cubed centimeters (gm/cm^3).It is used to estimate body composition, as fat is less dense than fat-free mass (muscle, bone, water). A higher body density indicates a lower body fat percentage (target). There is low variability among samples, with a standard deviation of 0.0190 around the mean of 1.0555, and a narrow range of approx 0.1. \n",
    "\n",
    "'Age' - The 'Age' column corresponds to the age in years of each individual data is recorded for. Ages range from 22-81 years old, with over 75% of data representing individuals in the younger half of this range (under 59). While the dataset ingested this column as a float, it could also be saved as an integer with no value lost. Body fat typically increases as a person ages, indicating older age groups may have a higher value for the body fat 'target' variable. \n",
    "\n",
    "'Weight' - This is the weight in pounds of each individual, ranging from 118.5 - 363.15 lbs with a low variability around the mean. A weight measure is a sum of all body mass, including fat, muscle, bone, and water. While it can indicate body fat percentage in tandem with other body measurements, a high or low value may be a misleading indicator on its own as there are additional factors contributing to an individuals high or low body weight. For example, an individual with high muscle mass will most likely still have a higher weight, but not necessarily high body fat. \n",
    "\n",
    "'Height' - The 'Height' column is a continous measure in inches of each individuals vertical distance from the bottom of the feet to the top of the head. Height can be used in conjucntion with other measures to better understand body fat, however it is not a direct indicator on its own. For example, it can be used with weight to calculate individuals BMI, which may be more indicative of body fat than either measure alone. The distribution of heights appears to have a central tendency, but the minimum value of 29.5 inches is a potential outlier that warrants further investigation, as it could skew statistical analyses and model results. \n",
    "\n",
    "'Neck' - The 'Neck' column includes the measurements in centimeters of individuals neck circumference. A larger neck circumference can be a risk factor for certain health issues and may correspond with a higher measure of body fat percentage. Measurements range from approx 31 to 51, wi\n",
